    <!-- In this Project we had to put the 'v-cloak' here DIRECTLY in the 'head' tag and not inside the 'style.scss'
    like we did in the previous Project because this time it WOULDN'T work. The reason is that we create our CSS 
    file as a JavaScript Module this time(we load it inside our 'main.js' file right at the top with the import), 
    and then Webpack TURNS it into a JavaScript Module. The consequence of this is that now the CSS doesn't actually
    load UNTIL the rest of the JavaScripts LOADS, that means that if we had our 'v-cloak' inside the CSS it wouldn't
    actually load untill the rest of the JavaScripts loads and that would take AWAY the point of using 'v-cloak'.
    For this reason 'v-cloak' HAS to be defined here inside the 'head' tag  -->
    <style>
        [v-cloak] {
            display: none !important;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <div id="app" v-cloak>

        <!-- This 'keep-alive' is a SPECIAL Component that when wrapped around a DYNAMIC Component(like our 
        'router-view' in this case) will CACHES the inactive Component instances without DESTROYING them. So pretty
        much Vue.js keep them in memory. In our case we're using it because if we applyied some filter and then
        we click on one of the filtered Movie to visit their "Detail" page and then we GET back on the home page
        by clicking on the 'Back to results' button, in the home page we would see ONLY the filtered movie and NOT
        all of them, because the other were DESTROYED and not kept in memory like they are now thanks to this
        'keep-alive' Component -->
        <keep-alive>
            <router-view v-bind:genre="genre" v-bind:time="time" v-bind:movies="movies" v-bind:day="day"></router-view>
        </keep-alive>
    </div>
